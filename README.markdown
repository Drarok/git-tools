# Git Tools

## Introduction

This is a collection of little scripts that I use regularly whilst working with Git.

## Installation

**TL;DR:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Drarok/git-tools.git
cd git-tools
./install.sh
```

## The Tools

### git-dead-branch

Lists (and optionally removes) branches that have been merged to "safe" branches â€“ develop and master by default.

```bash
develop $ git dead-branch
feature/new-buttons
fix/something-cool
```

```bash
develop $ git dead-branch --cleanup
Deleted branch feature/new-buttons (was 2dd9a39).
Deleted branch fix/something-cool (was a3a5173).
```

If you are merging many features to a long-lived branch, you can specify that branch as "safe":

```bash
develop $ git dead-branch
There are no dead branches.
develop $ git dead-branch version-2
Deleted branch feature/v2-major-stuff (was 12abda1).
Deleted branch fix/v2-bug-fixes (was b347334).
```

It also supports checking (but not removing) remote branches.

```bash
develop $ git dead-branch -a
remotes/origin/feature/something-merged
```

### git-merged

If you are on a branch that has been merged upstream (such as when you still have your just-merged Pull Request branch checked out), you can use this to tidy up. Think of is as saying "The current branch has been merged to *&lt;branch&gt;*".
It switches to the destination branch (develop by default), does a `pull`, then deletes the branch you were on.
Finally, it also performs a prune on the remote, keeping the list of remote branches in sync with upstream.

```bash
feature/new-buttons $ git merged
f628724..93a5b00  develop -> origin/develop
Deleted branch feature/new-buttons (was 2dd9a39).
develop $
```

```bash
hotfix/emergency-kittens $ git merged master
a5b8751..36c5316  master -> origin/master
Deleted branch hotfix/emergency-kittens (was 6adb76d).
master $
```

### git-publish

This one is extremely lazy. When you have a new branch you want to push, you have to specify its name, and set a flag if you want to track it. No longer! This tool is a lazy person's `git push -u $remote $current_branch`.

```bash
feature/brand-new-awesome $ git publish
Publishing feature/brand-new-awesome to origin.
Branch feature/brand-new-awesome set up to track remote branch feature/brand-new-awesome from origin.
```

```bash
feature/optional-remote-name $ git publish github
Publishing feature/optional-remote-name to github.
Branch feature/optional-remote-name set up to track remote branch feature/optional-remote-name from github.
```
